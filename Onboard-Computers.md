The Valkyrie platform includes two onboard 'high level' processors. We refer to the processors collectively as the _Brainstem_. Individually the processors are referred to by class, roll, or name, _Link_ and _Zelda_.

The _Link_ processor is located on the robot's right side, slightly dorsal, under the right arm. The _Zelda_ processor is located on the robots left side, slightly dorsal, under the left arm.

The primary differentiator between the two processors is the _Synapse_. The _Synapse_ is the board responsible for connecting the _Brainstem_ with the embedded processors (link to turbodrivers here) in the rest of the robot.

The _Link_ processor is installed with the realtime kernel patch.
