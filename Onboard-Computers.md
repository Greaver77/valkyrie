The Valkyrie platform includes two onboard 'high level' processors. We refer to the processors collectively as the _Brainstem_. Individually they are _Link_ and _Zelda_.

The _Link_ processor is located on the robot's right side. The _Zelda_ processor is located on the robots left side. 

The primary differentiator between the two processors is the _Synapse_. The _Synapse_ is the board responsible for connecting the _Brainstem_ with the embedded processors in the rest of the robot.
