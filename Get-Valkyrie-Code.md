##Valkyrie Code and You  
####A guide to fill your robot's soul  

### Step 1
The first thing you'll need is to setup your environment.

[Setup Valkyrie Developer Environment](Setup-Valkyrie-Developer-Environment)

### Step 2
There are two ways to get Valkyrie code. The first way is to use our precompiled Debians.  These packages are created from the master branch and are fairly stable.  The only times the master branch is updated is when we have a software release, or when there is a hotfix/patch for a bug.

The second way to get our code, more appropriate for unstable features or live editing, is to checkout our source code from this github.
