##Valkyrie Code and You  
####A guide to fill your robot's soul  

There are two ways to get Valkyrie code. The first way is to use our precompiled Debians. These Debians will always be hot and fresh from our Master branches and we guarantee* them to be stable.  

The second way to get our code, more appropriate for unstable features or live editing, is to checkout our source code from this github.
