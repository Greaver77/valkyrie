This page needs to contain the instructions for accessing and modifying the IPs of the Multisense.  

Also need to add pictures/video?/gif of how to route the ethernet cable of the Multisense from the primary onboard switch to Zelda's second NIC.  

## Overview  
As part of the [Cartman Release](Valkyrie-Software-Cartman-Release) we are modifying the connectivity path of the Multisense. This has shown in testing to be more stable and achieve overall better bandwidth.
