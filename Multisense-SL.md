This page needs to contain the instructions for accessing and modifying the IPs of the Multisense.  

##Table of Robot Multisense I.P. Addresses
Robot|IP Address|Gateway|NetMask
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:
Valkyrie A|192.168.1.11|192.168.1.1|255.255.255.0
Valkyrie B|192.168.1.21|192.168.1.1|255.255.255.0
Valkyrie C|192.168.1.31|192.168.1.1|255.255.255.0
Valkyrie D|192.168.1.41|192.168.1.1|255.255.255.0

Also need to add pictures/video?/gif of how to route the ethernet cable of the Multisense from the primary onboard switch to Zelda's second NIC.  

## Overview  
As part of the [Cartman Release](Valkyrie-Software-Cartman-Release) we are modifying the connectivity path of the Multisense. This has shown in testing to be more stable and achieve overall better bandwidth.
