This page essentially is a style guide as well, but really all one needs to do is clone the wiki space, for this wiki its: https://github.com/NASA-JSC-Robotics/valkyrie.wiki.git  

Make sure when you're adding pages you follow the github style. All pages **must** be capitalized. Some *special* pages will have an underscore infront of them, these are sitewide additions to the wiki pages and will show up on every page.  
Examples:
```
New-Page.md Home.md _Footer.md
```

Wikis on github use pure markdown for formatting.  
Note: In order to 'return' you have to add two blank spaces on the end of a line.  
If you *forget* to _add_ the **spaces**
you get __one__ run-on sentence.

***

_Be sure to look at the following **links** for a solid example for formatting._  
Also make sure to look at how you can do username @ mentions, SHA references, and github issue references.  
Everyone does markdown a bit different, make sure you use the official github markdown guides.  

* [Github Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Live Editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/)
* [Github wiki showcase](https://github.com/showcases/projects-with-great-wikis). Great examples
* [Link to great basic github wiki](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki)

The following is a ~~great~~ code fencing example :+1:

```python
print "hello world"
```

You can also inline `code examples` in a sentence.
