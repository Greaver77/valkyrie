# Requirements
To follow these instructions, you must first have the following:
* Working installation of Simulation Construction Set(SCS [LINK LINK LINK])(Optional of you want to roll your own walking controller)
* Valkyrie Software(get that [here](https://github.com/NASA-JSC-Robotics/valkyrie/wiki/Get-Our-Code))
* Gazebo 4(Instructions for upgrading from Gazebo 2.x to Gazebo 4.x can be found [here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_wrapper_versions))

# Getting Started
This tutorial details how to get Valkyrie walking around in Gazebo using the walking controller provided by The Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition([IHMC](http://robots.ihmc.us/)), and works very much the same as getting the IHMC walking controller running on the real Valkyrie. First, the controller must be deployed to the robot, which in the case of simulation your local machine will be acting as the robot. To deploy IHMC's controller, you will need to add a Run Configuration in Eclipse. To do this, click the dropdown arrow next to the green play button([[images/EclipsePlayButton.png]]) near the top of Eclipse and select 'RunConfigurations...',
