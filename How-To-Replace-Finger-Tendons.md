### Tendon-Actuator Tendon Routing
The following table/graphic show which forearm motors correspond to which finger,


### Tendon Lengths
Each forearm has slightly different tendon lengths. When replacing a tendon, make sure to use the length corresponding to the forearm you are working with. Each forearm contains a serial number. There will be a label on each forearm that designates the serial number for that particular forearm, and it should look something like 'v_h_xxx', where 'h' specifies that it is a forearm assembly and the 'xxx' is a 3 digit number. Once you have found your serial number, the following table will tell you the correct tendon lengths,

| Forearm Serial Number | Thumb Distal Length(inches) | Thumb Proximal Length(inches) | Index Finger Length(inches) | Middle Finger Length(inches) | Pinky Finger Length(inches) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| v_h_005 | 12.1 | 9.625 | 10.6 | 13.35 | 11.25 |
