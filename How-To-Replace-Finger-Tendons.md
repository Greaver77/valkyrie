This page provides detailed directions for broken tendons that operate the fingers and thumb on Valkyie's hands. 

### Tendon-Actuator Tendon Routing
The following table/graphic show which forearm motors correspond to which finger,

[[images/valFingerActuatorLayout.png]]

| Finger/Tendon | Motor Location |
| :---: | :---: |
| Index | F1 |
| Pinky | F2 |
| Thumb Distal | F3 |
| Middle | F4 |
| Thumb Proximal | F5 | 

### Tendon Lengths
Each forearm has slightly different tendon lengths. When replacing a tendon, make sure to use the length corresponding to the forearm you are working with. Each forearm contains a serial number. There will be a label on each forearm that designates the serial number for that particular forearm, and it should look something like 'v_h_xxx', where 'h' specifies that it is a forearm assembly and the 'xxx' is a 3 digit number. Once you have found your serial number, the following table will tell you the correct tendon lengths,


##### Table 1
| Forearm Serial Number | Thumb Distal Length(inches) | Thumb Proximal Length(inches) | Index Finger Length(inches) | Middle Finger Length(inches) | Pinky Finger Length(inches) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| v_h_005 | 12.1 | 9.625 | 10.6 | 13.35 | 11.25 |
| v_h_006 | 12.5 | 9.5 | 10.5 | 13.375 | 10.75 |

### Tendon Making Protocol
You will need the following tools,

- Sharp exacto blade
- Hook nose forceps
- 2-3" length of 32 gauge wire
- Marker/Pen/Sharpie
- Size 18 tapestry needle (0.05" diameter)
- Scale

The following table lists key points/measurements that will be referenced later,

| Actuator/Pulley Side | Pin/Finger Termination Side |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1.5" - a minimum to place tail marking | X.X" - length of tendon(from Table 1) from end of larger eye loop (also B top of eye loop) to point "B" |
| 1.5" - From tail mark to point "A" | 0.25" - To points "A" and "C", point "A" is closer to the free end of the tendon |
| 0.5" -From point "A" to point "B" | 1.5" - From point "A" for tail mark | 
| 0.5" - From point "B" to point "C" | - |

1. Mark tendon material with points A, B, C, and tail length,
