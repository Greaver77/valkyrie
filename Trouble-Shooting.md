When running Valkyrie there will undoubtedly be times where you find yourself in a situation that you are unsure how to recover from whether it be an actuator fault that won't clear, a piece of software that is crashing, or a handful of other situations you may need help recovering from. On this page we will attempt to list all of the possible issues we think you might run into as well as the way(s) to get Valkyrie up and moving again. If you find yourself in a situation not listed here, please create an issue on our [issues page](https://github.com/NASA-JSC-Robotics/valkyrie/issues) and we'll get to it as soon as we can. 

### An actuator is faulted and I can't clear it

### Logic power will turn on, but motor power will not

### While running the robot, logic power turned off

### While running the robot, 1 or both computers crashed and logic power turned off

### Clicking UI buttons results in a bunch of "Request Timed Out" error messages in the UI log window
