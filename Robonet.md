Robonet is a two-wire field bus developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center.  This bus has typically been used for communication between a general purpose computer (a.k.a. the 'brainstem') within a robotic system and embedded motor controller modules.  The topology of a Robonet network is comprised of a single master node, called the **robonet master**, and one or slave nodes.  The slave nodes can further be distributed across one or more independent two-wire pairs called **channels**.

In Valkyire, the robonet master is a PCMCIA card called the **Synapse**.  The Synapse supports up to 8 robonet channels, where each channel can contain up to 8 nodes (not including the master).
