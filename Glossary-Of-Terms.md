**COM Express** - Computer-On-Module (COM) is a highly integrated and compact PC form factor.  This is the form factor of the main computers used on Valkyrie.  For more information, [Computer-on-module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-on-module) entry on Wikipedia  

**ER/ER4** - ER is the designated code for the Software, Robotics, and Simulation Division at NASA's Johnson Space Center.  ER4 is the code used for the Robotics Systems Technology Branch within the division.  

**HAPI** - Hardware API  

**JSC** - Johnson Space Center  

**MLVDS** - Multi-drop Low-voltage Differential Signal.  MLVDS is a physical-layer electrical specification.  MLVDS is the physical layer used by [Robonet](Robonet)  

**Robonet** - Robonet is the field bus that connects the main computers to the embedded controllers.  See [here](Robonet) for more information.

**Juice Box** - This is our term for the box that holds the power sources. It also holds a network attached storage(NAS) device for storing log files as well as a wireless router.

**Turbodriver** - Turbodrivers are the motor controllers for pretty much all series elastic joints on Valkyrie. These can be found throughout the robot. They are not very visible with the covers on.

**Vanguard** - Vanguard is a software suite used to empower operators to interact with remote systems (like robots) in a safe, managed way, over communication channels that would normally allow unsafe commanding.  Tasks ranging from editing files, to installing software, to starting and stopping the processes are accomplished through a well-defined communication interface.  Vanguard implements the Majordomo Protocol(https://github.com/zeromq/majordomo) with a collection of task-specific workers and accompanying clients.  The deployment of Vanguard components is flexible and can be custom tailored to meet the needs of simple "remote execution" systems as well as human-rated safety critical systems.
**Zelda**-The non real-time computer. Zelda is located on the robots left.
