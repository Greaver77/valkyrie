# Prerequisites
* Before calibrating Valkyrie's joints you must have the [Valkyrie software](https://github.com/NASA-JSC-Robotics/valkyrie/wiki/Get-Our-Code)
* You must be using the source installation of val_description on the robot, otherwise the updated joint offsets will be lost the next time you update your debian install of val_description.
