# Prerequisites
1. Before calibrating Valkyrie's joints you must have the [Valkyrie software](https://github.com/NASA-JSC-Robotics/valkyrie/wiki/Get-Valkyrie-Code)
2. You must be using the source installation of val_description on the robot, otherwise the updated joint offsets will be lost the next time you update your debian install of val_description and you will need to redo the calibration process
3. You must have logic power on and the actuator coefficients loaded. See [this page](Booting Up Valkyrie) for instructions on how to do this.

# Recommended Tools
* M2-M6 hex drivers. This will cover pretty much all bolts on the robot
* Magnet. Optional but can help prevent screws from falling into hard-to-reach places
* Extreme patience

# Calibrating Valkyrie's Joints
You will first need to remove the soft goods surrounding the joint(s) you are calibrating. If you are calibrating the entire robot, it will save time if you just remove them all up front.
